## Overview
Fraud Detection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial transactions. This project leverages **machine learning models** to identify potentially fraudulent activities. By analyzing historical data, the system can flag suspicious transactions and alert the concerned parties before a loss occurs. The primary focus is on detecting financial fraud, such as credit card fraud and online payment fraud.

## Features
- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Identify and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implements models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Scalable System**: Can handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into transaction patterns with clear visual representations.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different fraud detection scenarios.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd fraud-detection
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Download the dataset** (link to dataset can be included):
    Place the dataset in the `/data` folder.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start training the model or run predictions:

1. **Train the model**:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

2. **Run predictions on new data**:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input your_input_file.csv
    ```

3. **Evaluate model performance**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

4. **Visualize results**:
    Run the Jupyter notebook to visualize transaction patterns:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook visualization.ipynb
    ```

## Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **XGBoost**: Advanced tree-based boosting method.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
